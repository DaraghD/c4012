Challenging Homelessness, One Home at a Time...

<p class="text1">
What is Homelessness Limerick? We are a Not-For-Profit based in the mid-west region of Munster, who's mission it is to end homelessness in Limerick for good,
one home at a time. With the continued support of our volunteers, donours, our staff, and our supporters within the community, we have managed to make an impact already. 
However, with homelessness continuously growing in Limerick, we need your help more than ever.
